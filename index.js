  TASK 1
    - Write a Person Constructor that initializes `name` and `age` from arguments.
    - All instances of Person should initialize with an empty `stomach` array.
    - Give instances of Person the ability to `.eat("someFood")`:
        + When eating an edible, it should be pushed into the `stomach`.
        + The `eat` method should have no effect if there are 10 items in the `stomach`.
    - Give instances of Person the ability to `.poop()`:
        + When an instance poops, its `stomach` should empty.
    - Give instances of Person a method `.toString()`:
        + It should return a string with `name` and `age`. Example: "Mary, 50"

/*
  TASK 2
    - Write a Car constructor that initializes `model` and `milesPerGallon` from arguments.
    - All instances built with Car:
        + should initialize with an `tank` at 0
        + should initialize with an `odometer` at 0
    - Give cars the ability to get fueled with a `.fill(gallons)` method. Add the gallons to `tank`.
    - STRETCH: Give cars ability to `.drive(distance)`. The distance driven:
        + Should cause the `odometer` to go up.
        + Should cause the the `tank` to go down taking `milesPerGallon` into account.
    - STRETCH: A car which runs out of `fuel` while driving can't drive any more distance:
        + The `drive` method should return a string "I ran out of fuel at x miles!" x being `odometer`.

/*
  TASK 3
    - Write a Baby constructor subclassing Person.
    - Besides `name` and `age`, Baby takes a third argument to initialize `favoriteToy`.
    - Besides the methods on Person.prototype, babies have the ability to `.play()`:
        + Should return a string "Playing with x", x being the favorite toy.

/* 
  TASK 4
  In your own words explain the four principles for the "this" keyword below:
  1. window/global
    basically a NON-use case; great for debugging. if nothing else applies, 'this' binds to the window
  2. implicit binding
    most of the above uses implicit binding; this binds contextually the function relative to its call
  3. explicit binding
    there are specific ways to bind this more explicitly: call, apply, and bind. "call" helps children inherit parent methods. Bind can transfer over bindings to create a new function, without invoking anything. Apply? Haven't gone over it yet.
  4. "new" binding
    this is a specified version of principle #2. It's bound relative to the context of a function, but more specifically, constructor functions/methods. Invoking these functions with the 'new' keyword binds any instance of 'this' to the newly constructed object.
